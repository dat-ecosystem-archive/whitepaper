# Creating + Generating Paper from Markdown

[See this gist](https://gist.github.com/maxogden/97190db73ac19fc6c1d9beee1a6e4fc8) for more information on how the paper is created with a basic example.

To generate the paper again, make sure you have `pandoc` and `pandoc-citeproc`:

```
brew install pandoc pandoc-citeproc
```

Then run the build script in `source`.
